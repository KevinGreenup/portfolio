    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hello I'm Kevin from sunny Stockport. I've spent the past decade teaching
      English in Spain and recently returned to start my computer programming
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently on a computer programming bootcamp with Command Shift and
      will finish in March 2024.
